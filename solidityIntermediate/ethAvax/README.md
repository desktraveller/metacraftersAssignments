# Degen NBA 2K Contract

Welcome to the Degen NBA 2K Contract repository! This smart contract, known as "Degen," is designed to bring NBA 2K-themed collectibles to the blockchain. 

It's currently deployed on the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain testnet for testing and demonstration purposes.

## About the Contract

"Degen NBA 2K Contract" is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token that represents in-game items and assets from the popular NBA 2K series.

Players and collectors can trade, buy, and sell these virtual assets securely on the blockchain.

## Deployment on Avalanche Fuji Testnet

We've deployed the contract on the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain testnet to ensure its functionality and security before considering a mainnet deployment. 

The testnet deployment allows us to:

- Test contract functionality.
- Verify interactions with in-game assets.
- Ensure the contract works seamlessly in a controlled environment.

## How to Interact

If you'd like to explore the contract or interact with it on the Avalanche Fuji testnet, follow these steps:

1. **Access Remix IDE**: Go to the [Remix Solidity IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New File**: In Remix, create a new file named `Degen.sol`.

3. **Copy and Paste Code**: Copy the contract code from this repository and paste it into `Degen.sol`.

4. **Compile and Import**: Compile the contract and import it from the Avalanche Fuji testnet using Remix. Ensure you have the correct MetaMask wallet configured for the Fuji testnet.

5. **Import**: Import from this address on the fuji testnet "0xfed6D5fa979FDF38cceB80577C27a8E7F38E78BA".

6. **verification**: contract is verified on the fuji testnet for transparency

7. **Explore and Test**: After deployment, you can interact with the contract by minting tokens, buying in-game items from the store, and checking ownership of assets.

## Important Note

Remember that this contract is currently deployed on the Avalanche Fuji testnet, and any transactions involving it are not related to the mainnet or real NBA 2K assets. Use the testnet deployment for testing and exploration purposes only.
