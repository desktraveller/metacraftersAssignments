# Project Title

Solidity Contract for Error Handling

## Description

This Solidity contract, named "errors," serves as a demonstration of various error-handling mechanisms in Solidity smart contracts. It defines three functions, each illustrating a different approach to error handling in Ethereum contracts. Additionally, the contract maintains an `owner` address and a `score` variable.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To interact with this Solidity contract, you need an Ethereum development environment and Solidity compiler. You can set up such an environment using tools like [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

### Executing program

1. Deploy the "errors" contract to an Ethereum development or test network using your preferred Ethereum development tool.

2. Interact with the contract by calling its functions using a tool like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or by creating a front-end interface.

## Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the "errors" contract, you can refer to the contract's documentation or seek assistance from the Ethereum development community.
